## Company: Nexus
**Duration**: May 2024 - June 2024  
**Description**: During my internship at Null Class Pvt Ltd, I specialized in advancing emotion detection algorithms through a series of focused tasks. I compared time-series models with static image-based approaches, developed dynamic model adaptation for personalized predictions, and integrated cultural context to enhance cross-cultural recognition accuracy. Additionally, I created real-time emotion detection systems for streaming video data and trained multi-context models.
