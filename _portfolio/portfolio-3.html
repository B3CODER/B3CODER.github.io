In the quest to enhance surveillance capabilities, the development of an advanced video anomaly detection system is pivotal. Leveraging OpenCV for video preprocessing and TensorFlow with Ultralytics YOLO for real-time object detection, this system integrates image-level anomaly detection using ResNet50 and speed estimation to identify deviations from expected norms. Advanced techniques like Z-score analysis and DBSCAN further refine anomaly detection, promising to revolutionize surveillance with enhanced safety and security applications across diverse domains.
